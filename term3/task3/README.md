# A. MST-1 (2 points)

### Time limit 1 second

### Memory limit 256Mb

### Input standard input or input.txt

### Output standard output or output.txt

It is required to find a minimum weight spanning tree in a connected graph.

##### Use the Prim algorithm.

### Input format
The first line of the input file contains two natural numbers n and m — the number of vertices and edges of the graph, respectively. The next m lines contain a description of the edges, one per line. Edge number i is described by three natural numbers bi, ei and wi - the numbers of the ends of the edge and its weight, respectively (1 ≤ bi, ei ≤ n, 0 ≤ wi ≤ 100,000). n ≤ 5 000, m ≤ 100 000.

The graph is connected.

### Output format
The first line of the output file must contain one natural number — the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

It is required to find a minimum weight spanning tree in a connected graph.

##### Use the Kruskal algorithm.

### Input format
The first line of the input file contains two natural numbers n and m — the number of vertices and edges of the graph, respectively. The next m lines contain a description of the edges, one per line. Edge number i is described by three natural numbers bi, ei and wi - the numbers of the ends of the edge and its weight, respectively (1 ≤ bi, ei ≤ n, 0 ≤ wi ≤ 100,000). n ≤ 20 000, m ≤ 100 000.

The graph is connected.

### Output format
The first line of the output file must contain one natural number — the weight of the minimum spanning tree.
